It takes any data structure (list, vector, map, set,\nseq), calls a function on every element, and uses the return value\nof the function in place of the original.  This makes it fairly\neasy to write recursive search-and-replace functions, as shown in\nthe examples.\n\nNote: \"walk\" supports all Clojure data structures EXCEPT maps\ncreated with sorted-map-by.
